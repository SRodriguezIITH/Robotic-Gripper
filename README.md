Welcome to my Project on optimizing complexity and cost of Robotiq 3 Finger Gripper.
This is a submission made in accordance for acceptance to the Tinkerers; Lab IIT Hyderabad.

CREATED BY: SONIT PATIL (bm23btech11023)

This Folder 3.1.1 consists of
[text](<APPROACH - 1 Monoservo gear Gripper>)
[text](<APPROACH-2 SMA Gripper>)
[text](Reports)

The first two files delves deep into engineering design of the gripper. Reports folder contains 1 concise report on both approaches.

Brief:
Approach 1 Delves into gear mechanisms
Approach 2- Delves into Thermophillic Shape Memory Alloys for mechanism.
Report consists of preface, design advantages limitations and omtimized costing and complexity analysis.

Make sure to go through every README given to understand project and refer to any additional research articles if necessary.

Thank You.
