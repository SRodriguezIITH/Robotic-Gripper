Project Made Using SolidEdge 2024
All CAD files are in either par and asm format.

bm23btech11023_mechatronics_Sonit.pdf which has a concise report on my design and analysis of initial design and cost limitations on both approaches is in the Report Folder of .zip file

THIS FOLDER CONTAINS:
Mathematical Model - To relate elastic strength of mesh to tensil strength of SMA ring.
Parts Folder which contains 3 different parts:
[text](<Parts/Heating Element Source Par.par>)
[text](<Parts/SMA Parboloid Gripper Mesh.par>)
[text](<Parts/Wrist module.par>)

And the assembly of SMA gripper.

Thank You.
